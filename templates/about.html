      I've been a long time advocate of yoga, hiking, and meditation as
      additions to any lifestyle type. While yoga may not be as ancient as it
      claims, the health benifits both mentally and physically are evident. This
      site serves as a starting point. From personal experience and quantitative
      evidence I've come to find that consistant record keeping and
      accountability are 2 major points of concern for anyone trying to improve
      any aspect of their health.

      Tristan is best known for his hit workout program "EMBRACE THE GAINS". As a fitness/lifestyle coach, he has seen all types of so-called fitness apps but none of them seemed to satisfy his and his clients needs for success. Tristan is passionate about fitness and changing people's lives through it. With this in mind, Ohmyquad was born. It is his love and passion for the game, manifested into a piece of software.
